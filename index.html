					<h2>Scorched Pololu A4988</h2>
					<p>Killed my first <a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1182" target="_blank">Pololu A4988</a> today. From what I have red, it won't be the last. I messed up the wiring. VMOT and GND were switched, also VDD wasn't connected. The result was a short glow, follwed by a small flame until I switched off the power. Sadly the connected, brand new, <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue" target="_blank">Arduino Due</a> got a little bit damaged. The digital pin 13 won't turn off any more and the Arduino gets really hot. Otherwise it works.</p>
